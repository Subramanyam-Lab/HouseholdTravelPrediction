NHTS Machine Learning Project
This project is focused on utilizing Machine Learning techniques, such as linear and logistic regression, on the NHTS (National Household Travel Survey) dataset.
---------------------------------
Directory Organization
---------------------------------
The project directory is organized as follows:

- Codes/: Python codes that are used for developing and implementing machine learning models.

- Dataset/: Datasets that are used for training and testing machine learning models.

- Instructions/: Communications and instructions from the project advisor.

- Presentations/: Presentation slides and project updates.

---------------------------------
Project Description
---------------------------------
The goal of this project is to explore the NHTS dataset and develop Machine Learning models that can accurately predict household travel behavior. To achieve this, we will be using techniques such as linear regression and logistic regression.

---------------------------------
Dataset Description
---------------------------------
The NHTS dataset is a national survey conducted by the Federal Highway Administration in the United States. It contains information about household travel behavior, including trip purpose, mode of transportation, and distance traveled. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed from the National Household Travel Survey website.
